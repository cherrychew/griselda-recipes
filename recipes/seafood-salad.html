<p>The base of this salad is shrimp and imitation crab meat. The seafood is combined with celery, red onion, fresh dill, Old Bay seasoning, lemon juice and mayonnaise. Everything gets tossed together to make an ultra creamy and flavorful salad.</p>
<p>Lamb loin chops look like mini T-bone steaks with both the loin and filet sold as part of the steak. Lamb rib chops are a carnivore’s lollipop — they’re the individual servings cut from a rack of lamb. You may see the chops “frenched” (cleaned of the fat and meat along the bone), leaving only the tender meat at the end. Frenching the chops is for appearance only, so if you don’t feel like tackling the task, you can ask your butcher to do it or skip it altogether.</p>

    <li>In a food processor fitted with a metal blade add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cayenne, and salt. Pulse until combined.</li>

    <li>Remove from refrigerator and allow the chops to come to room temperature; it will take about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat a grill pan over high heat until almost smoking, add the chops and sear for about 2 minutes. Flip the chops over and cook for another 3 minutes for medium-rare and 3 1/2 minutes for medium.</li>

        <p>Surprise — you can buy lamb chops at your local grocery store! While lamb isn’t allotted the same volume of real estate afforded to beef, pork, or chicken, you’ll still find a good number of cuts available. The two most popular types of lamb chops are loin and rib chops. (You may also see blade or sirloin chops in the meat case; these cuts are a bit tougher, so they take slightly longer to cook and have a gamier flavor.)</p>
        <p>Lamb loin chops look like mini T-bone steaks with both the loin and filet sold as part of the steak. Lamb rib chops are a carnivore’s lollipop — they’re the individual servings cut from a rack of lamb. You may see the chops “frenched” (cleaned of the fat and meat along the bone), leaving only the tender meat at the end. Frenching the chops is for appearance only, so if you don’t feel like tackling the task, you can ask your butcher to do it or skip it altogether.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a food processor fitted with a metal blade add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cayenne, and salt. Pulse until combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour in olive oil and pulse into a paste. Rub the paste on both sides of the lamb chops and let them marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Remove from refrigerator and allow the chops to come to room temperature; it will take about 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat a grill pan over high heat until almost smoking, add the chops and sear for about 2 minutes. Flip the chops over and cook for another 3 minutes for medium-rare and 3 1/2 minutes for medium.</li>
